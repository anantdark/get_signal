## What is signal?
<p>Signal is an open-source app, designed to provide the ultimate privacy messaging experience.
Many of you might be using whatsapp, but today I am going to present my case on why signal is a better alternative.</p>

# SECURITY and PRIVACY
<p> Signal is by far the ***best*** when it comes to protecting user privacy. It is better than Whatsapp by a long shot.<br> Signal uses the **open-source** Signal Protcol to implement the end-to-end encryption in its messages.
  <br><br>
  Signal encrypts your messages, calls, and even the metadata. Signal is the only messaging app that encrypts even the metadata to prrotect the user from all fronts.
