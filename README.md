## What is signal?
Signal is an open-source app, designed to be secure yet provide a seamless messaging experience.
Many of you might be using whatsapp, but today I am going to present my case on why signal is a better alternative.

# SECURITY and PRIVACY
Signal is by far the **best** when it comes to protecting user privacy. It is better than Whatsapp by a long shot. Signal uses the **open-source** Signal Protcol to implement the end-to-end encryption in its messages.
<br><br>
## Industry leading encryption standard
Signal encrypts your messages, calls, and even the metadata. Signal is the only messaging app that encrypts even the metadata to protect the user from all fronts.<br>

> Metadata refers to the data about the data. For example if you share an image, it contains the EXIF information about the device model, camera resolution, time, location, etc.

Signal uses state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption *(powered by the **open source Signal Protocol**)* which is touted as the gold standard of encryption by many cybersecurity professionals. Even Signal can't read your messages as the chats are end-to-end encrypted.<br>

> End-to-End chats are encrypted from the sender's device and decrypted at the reciever's device using a secure cryptographic key. And since the messages are stored on the local storage instead of the server, only you are in control.

To prevent physical access to the messages, the messages are stored on the storage in encrypted format. Therefore if your mobile is storen or the storage is compromised, the chats are irretrieveable. Moreover, the app supports biometric authentication/screen lock to prevent unauthorised access.

## Stored data
Signal stores as minimal data as possible. If ever the signal servers are hacked, they will only contain the *account creation date* and *last connection date*. See how even FBI lost it to the privacy of Signal messenger [here](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/signal-subpoena-privacy-gag-order/).

> "The only Signal user data we have, and the only data the US government obtained as a result, was the date of last use -- **NOT** user messages, groups, contacts, profile information, or anything else." -Signal.org

<br><br>
## Contacts
Signal doesn't directly sends any of your contact list to the server. Instead, it uses a *cryptographic hash function* to obfuscate phone numbers before sending them to the server.
<br><br>
## Sealed sender
In addition to the end-to-end encryption that protects every Signal message, The Signal service is designed to minimise the data that is retained about signal users. By design it **does not** store a record of your contacts, social graph, conversation list, profile name, avatar, group memberships, group titles, etc.

## Open Source
Being open source is another perk of Signal messenger, as the whole code is published on github, anyone can verify the code, suggest improvements, report security errors. In Contrast, whatsapp is closed source, so any vulnerability has a high chance of being expoloited.

# Features
Ok, now you have an idea about the security of signal messenger. Let's talk features.

## Note to Self
Ever wanted to jot down something quickly? Why not use Signal for that too. Compose a message and select "Note to Self" in the contact list. Don't worry this is end-to-end encrypted too. You can even write your passwords here (although i would recommend a password manager for that).

## View-once media
Want to send your photo, but don't want it to be stored on the reciever's device? Don't worry, Signal has you covered. Just select to send a view-once message and it will be deleted as soon as the reciever views the media. *kaboom!*
