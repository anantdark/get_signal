## What is signal?
Signal is an open-source app, designed to be secure yet provide a seamless messaging experience.
Many of you might be using whatsapp, but today I am going to present my case on why signal is a better alternative.

# SECURITY and PRIVACY
Signal is by far the **best** when it comes to protecting user privacy. It is better than Whatsapp by a long shot. Signal uses the **open-source** Signal Protcol to implement the end-to-end encryption in its messages.
<br><br>
## Industry leading encryption standard
Signal encrypts your messages, calls, and even the metadata. Signal is the only messaging app that encrypts even the metadata to protect the user from all fronts.<br>
> Metadata refers to the data about the data. For example if you share an image, it contains the EXIF information about the device model, camera resolution, time, location, etc.
Signal uses state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption *(powered by the **open source Signal Protocol**)* which is touted as the gold standard of encryption by many cybersecurity professionals. Even Signal can't read your messages as the chats are end-to-end encrypted.<br> End-to-End chats are encrypted from the sender's device and decrypted at the reciever's device. Therefore no MITM(man-in-the-middle) attack can be performed.<br><br>
To prevent physical access to the messages, the messages are stored on the storage in encrypted format. Therefore if your mobile is storen or the storage is compromised, the chats are irretrieveable. Moreover, the app supports biometric authentication/screen lock to prevent unauthorised access.
